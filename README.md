# finale-project

## THE PROJECT
The project in itself is a web API with a dashboard that should allow to :
  - Access a home page
  - Sign In / Sign Up / Sign Out
  - Insert/update/delete metrics once logged in

## INSTRUCTION

### Build 

To build the project into your desktop you need to type first in your terminal :   
 
```
npm run build
```

### Development 

To make the projet run you have to type in your terminal : 

```
npm run dev or npm start
```

### Test

By using Mocha and Chai, we created some tests.
To run the test module, you just need to type in your terminal : 
```
npm test 
```

## Web site

The server listens on port 3000 of your localhost.
So, to checkout the App, Go to your [LocalHost (app)](http://localhost:3000/)

### Docker

To run docker
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Difficulties

For DevOps :
A limitation was the web-project. So we code 2 tests that are not working but we think it should work if we had succeeded to do more on the web-project.
